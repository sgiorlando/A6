    File Description: This file is a webpage that shows the user a form where they can enter
    a range of numbers.  Once they enter the numbers a multiplication table is created from the beginning
    of their range to the end of their range specified.  This table is also limited in range, and does not allow
    the user to enter any type of letters or symbols that are not represented as letters.

    This file did pass all the validators that need to be used.
